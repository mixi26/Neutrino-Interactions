\section{Aim}
    Over the course of my experiment, I am aiming to confirm relationships between various factors and the natural frequency of taut wires. These factors include the linear density of the wire, size of tension force on the wire, and the length of the region of wire being oscillated. I also hope to explore whether there are limits to these relationships. \\ \\
    Research questions for the project include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the effect that the following variables have on the natural frequency of a taut wire?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Force of tension on wire
                \item Length of wire that is being oscillated
                \item Diameter of wire
                \item Linear density of wire
            \end{itemize}
        \item Do any relationships found have limitations?
        \item How much deformation do the wires undergo, and how does this affect the relationships?
    \end{itemize}
